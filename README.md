## EXPERIENCE

### Onepoint Consulting LTD  

**Apprentice Software Engineer**  
*September 2021 - January 2025*

Web Scraping Platform & Boomi Development 

Joined a dynamic, collaborative team responsible for monitoring, maintaining, and enhancing a Java-based web scraping platform used for client data delivery. Worked across backend and frontend systems, ensuring data reliability and system stability, while contributing to monitoring tools and disaster recovery processes.
Key responsibilities and achievements:
- Maintained and monitored the React-based frontend, displaying scraping progress and ensuring data accuracy, while troubleshooting proxy issues to prevent disruptions to data access.
- Managed and analysed system logs and machine metrics using Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki; investigated and resolved dashboard and monitoring issues by self-learning Grafana setup, query languages, and Go templating for alert customisation via Discord and email.
- Developed, tested, and deployed bug fixes and feature updates through unit tests, integration tests, and controlled testing server deployments.
- Enhanced backend functionality to support frontend features, including:
  - Forcing different phases of the scraping process
  - Updating site-specific scraping code to adapt to API changes, security updates, and layout modifications
  - Adjusting configuration parameters for improved scraping reliability
- Performed routine maintenance, including clearing log files and triggering re-scrapes via Mongo commands.
- Contributed to the disaster recovery system using AWS CloudFormation, creating bash scripts to automate file structure setup, application installation, Git repository cloning, and starting Vert.x and Mongo clusters across multiple virtual machines. This facilitated a migration from CentOS to Ubuntu.
- Gained hands-on experience with React and TypeScript by adding frontend features and integrating backend modifications.

Final Year Project – Boomi Connector Wrapper

- Developed a Boomi wrapper to extend existing Boomi connector implementations (e.g., database and Snowflake) with additional functionality, including parallel processing, statistical extensions, and circuit-breaker features, using Java and Kotlin.
- Contributed to the company’s internal development framework, supporting upgrades of current and future client-based projects, and laying groundwork for a potential commercial framework for other consultancies and software development companies.

**Associate Software Engineer**  
*January 2025 - July 2025*

Boomi Development & AI Agents 

- Continued development of the Boomi connector wrapper and explored tailoring AI agents to showcase use cases for the company’s AI connector alongside its Wikipedia, database, and web-search connectors.
- Created several Boomi AI agents using in-house developed Boomi connectors within the Boomi Integration platform, communicating with a user interface built in Boomi Flow; these agents were published on the Boomi Marketplace.
- Assisted in developing in-house Boomi connectors, including testing within the Boomi platform and migrating code and tests from Java to Kotlin for better maintainability. Connectors worked on include Database (SQL and non-SQL), Web Search, Wikipedia and AI.
- Aided in creating Boomi connector extensions to enhance functionality, including Parallel processing, Circuit breaker and Data transformer (templating languages for formatting and converting JSON to CSV/TSV)
- Developed an application to wrap Boomi connectors with additional functionality, allowing testing both locally and within Boomi. Implemented via a Gradle project in Kotlin, generating archives as custom connectors, with configurable YAML-based tests.
- Undertook informal training on the Azure platform, focusing on Logic Apps, Pipelines, Power Automate, Blob Storage and Log Analyser.
